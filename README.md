[Check IT out]()

    Greetings! I am a new developer trying out some new projects with different techniques. Here I developed a e-Commerce Storefront from the backend. I used a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

## ü™Ñ User Story
```

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## üåê How to Operate 

### Usage Instructions

1. Repository: Open documentation run 'npm i' and update '.env'.

2. Create database: use the schema.sql file in the db folder with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

3. Run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with test data. Then, run 'npm start' or 'nodemon' to start the server and sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database.

4. Generate a development database with test data, use the schema and seed commands.

5. Use Insomnia to test http://localhost:3001 with the following route end points API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags, ensuring successful creation, updating, and deletion of data in the database.
